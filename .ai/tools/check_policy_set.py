"""Structural checks on the policy set.

Each check below states the exact question it answers, and the report prints
that question beside the result. See `.ai/CORE.md` § The question each result
answers for why that matters more than the pass/fail.

These guards read structure — front matter, headings, references, paths — and
not prose, per LESSONS_FROM_PRACTICE.md entry 14. The one exception is the
portability denylist, which searches for proper nouns rather than for a rule,
and is opt-in per repository.

Python 3.11+ standard library only. Run from the repository root:

    python3 .ai/tools/check_policy_set.py [repository root]

The root defaults to the repository this file lives in; pass one to check a
copy, which is how `test_check_policy_set.py` proves each guard fails on the
defect it exists to catch.

Exit status is 0 when every check passes and 1 otherwise.

# as SET_HOME_FILES, reached from the other direction.
#
# The tolerance is wider than "absent", and that is a known blind spot. In an
# adopter, a reference *into* a capability folder is excused even when the
# folder is there, because the check cannot tell a capability the adopter
# removed from one that never existed. A pointer written *inside* a capability
# is still checked; see `resolve()`.

# release been bumped, and bumped exactly once?
#
# `.ai/CHANGELOG.md` § Document versioning is the rule: one bump per release,
# sized by policy impact. The previous release is the oldest commit, walking
# first parents back from HEAD, in which its entry stood at the top of the
# changelog, with merges read as `previous_release_commit()` describes. Every
# commit of the
# release being made, before its entry was written or after, is compared with
# that one state, so a committed change is caught exactly as one still in the
# working tree is. `previous_release_commit()` is the detail.
#
# The changelog is compared without its release entries. They grow every
# release; its version describes its rules, not its record.
#
# Asked only at the set's home. An adopter cannot fix the set's history, and
# its commits are not the set's releases.
#
# NOT VERIFIED: whether the level matches the change's policy impact, which is
# a judgement, and anything before the previous release. A change committed
# without a release entry is counted in the next release that records one.
